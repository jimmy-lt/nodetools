Nodesnap
=======

Nodesnap is a python utility to make network nodes backups.

This tool connects to your Cisco and OmniSwitch devices by Telnet or SSH and
then gets their running's configuration. This configuration is written on the
local host.


INSTALL
-------

Packaging is one of future work to do.


Nodesnap depends of the pexpect module (http://www.noah.org/wiki/Pexpect).
You must install it before using this tool.

Change to the nodesnap source directory and run:

  python nodesnap.py /path/to/config_file.ini


FEATURES
--------

Nodesnap reads an INI file described futher. It will connect to all hosts
listed in this file. Nodesnap gets the host's running configuration and
compares it to the last saved configuration. If the new configuration differs,
this one is written on the disk.

Files are written on the disk by following this pattern:

  /root_directory/backup/(group)/(node's subsection)/file_pattern
  /root_directory/diff/(group)/(node's subsection)/file_pattern

Nodesnap supports Cisco and OmniSwitch devices. It can connect by SSH and
Telnet.

Nodesnap can sends e-mails containing the grabbed configuration and the
differences from the last backup.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

This utility needs an INI file for its configuration. Here are the different
sections and options.


 * General sections
   ----------------

[general]
root_directory = (string) " Working directory in which backups will be stored.
file_pattern   = (string) " Filename pattern.
                          " This pattern uses the Unix date format and a
                          " personal format:
                          "   - %0, node's hostname;
                          "   - %1, node's subsection name.
rotation      = (integer) " Number of files to keep in each directory. If this
                          " number is reached, oldest files will be deleted.
write_diff    = (bool)    " Do you want to write the difference between the
                          " last saved file and the running configuration?

[contact]
mail_server   = (string)  " Mail server address (localhost by default).
sender        = (string)  " Sender's e-mail address.
send_backup   = (bool)    " Send the last configuration.
send_diff     = (bool)    " Send the differences from the last backup file.

[contact::subsection]
e-mail        = (string)  " Recipient's e-mail address.

 * Node sections
   -------------

The Cisco section [Cisco] or OmniSwitch section [OmniSwitch] share the same
options.

[OmniSwitch] or [Cisco]
connection    = (string)  " This option has two possible value: ssh or telnet.
failover      = (string)  " This option is used when the 'connection' option
                          " fails. It takes the same values as the 'connection'
                          " option.
options       = (string)  " Not used for now.
username      = (string)  " Host user name.
password      = (string)  " Host password.
prompt        = (string)  " Host prompt (the value can be a regular expression).
timeout       = (integer) " Maximum time to wait (default 15 seconds).

[OmniSwitch::subsection] or [Cisco::subsection]
hostname      = (string)  " Host address
group         = (string)  " Host's group name. So, you can put many hosts
                          " together in the same directory.

* Good to know
  ------------

All section options can be overloaded in subsections. So you can redefine an
already defined section's option in a subsection. The last one will be used.


TODO
----

- Packaging
- A prettier logger solution
- Threads support for parallel connections
